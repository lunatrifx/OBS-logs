# OBS-logs
Hopefully no code; this is just a repository to document changes in my streaming setup as I look to find the most optimal and or best settings for A/V presentation.

I started streaming to Twitch on August 19, 2025 unofficially as a way to not have issues with my SSD in terms of space and avoiding issues in general (my PC went through a series of BSODs that fortunately no longer occurs, although I haven't found the root cause of it all even through
all the troubleshooting I have done. Maybe it is the SSD, maybe it was the GPU, or the CPU. I'll never know as the BSODs have again have subsided.)

I am documenting my tweaks to OBS as I want to troubleshoot why my streams are not of the best quality and to make changes that culminate in a proper stream. They are listed below in case you want to follow along or for any other reason.

SPECS:
* AMD Ryzen 5 5500
* NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB
* Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB
* Corsair DDR4 32GB
* Intel AX3000 Wifi 6
